            <strong>Electronics & ICT Academy IIT Roorkee (E&ICT IITR)</strong>
            is an initiative supported by MeitY, Govt of India to deliver short
            courses/FDPs/certificate courses in online as well as offline mode.
            Our courses lay emphasis on bridging the gap between industry demand
            and academic approach to learning and provide a foundation to build
            your career in the industries related to the ICT sector. All our
            courses have projects with real-life problems to give industry
            insights into learning. We have assimilated academic as well as
            industry experts to formulate the most effective courses that help
            professionals/students/faculty to upgrade their knowledge without
            disrupting their regular schedule. So far, we have conducted 200+
            courses and trained over 15,000 beneficiaries. The Courses are
            conducted by well-known industry partners, resource persons from
            leading academia, and experts from renowned R&D organisations. For
            this, the Academy has signed MoUâ€™s with Industry/R&D partners in
            different domains, who collaborate and work with us in conducting
            the training programs.
